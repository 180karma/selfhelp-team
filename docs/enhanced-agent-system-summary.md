# Enhanced AI Agent System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

The AI agent system has been significantly enhanced to provide structured, comprehensive therapeutic sessions with strict protocols and expanded roadmaps.

---

## üìö Key Components

### 1. **Agent Session Guide** (`docs/agent-session-guide.md`)

A comprehensive 500+ line markdown document that serves as the **strict protocol** for all AI agent interactions.

**Purpose:**
- Provides step-by-step instructions for conducting therapy sessions
- Ensures consistent, professional therapeutic approach
- Guides agents through 8 distinct session phases
- Includes extensive question banks and intervention strategies

**Session Structure:**
1. **Opening & Check-in** - Warm greeting and rapport building
2. **Issue Identification** - Exploring what client wants to work on
3. **Core Analysis** - Identifying wounds and mapping triggers
4. **Psychoeducation** - Explaining patterns and mechanisms
5. **Action Planning** - Introducing interventions
6. **Goal & Task Assignment** - Setting specific, measurable goals
7. **Closing Check** - Summary and "anything else?" question
8. **Closed** - Formal ending, wait for client to return

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Detailed question banks for different issues (anxiety, depression, trauma, relationships)
- ‚úÖ Core wound identification guide (7 common wounds)
- ‚úÖ Trigger mapping framework (Trigger ‚Üí Thought ‚Üí Emotion ‚Üí Behavior ‚Üí Consequence)
- ‚úÖ Psychoeducation templates for explaining psychological concepts
- ‚úÖ Intervention selection guide (cognitive, behavioral, emotional regulation, interpersonal)
- ‚úÖ SMART goal framework with examples
- ‚úÖ Mantra creation guidelines with 20+ examples
- ‚úÖ Strict closing protocol to respect client boundaries
- ‚úÖ Session documentation checklist

### 2. **Enhanced Roadmap System** (`src/ai/flows/create-roadmap.ts`)

Roadmaps now include PRIMARY and SUPPORTING modules for comprehensive treatment planning.

**Structure:**

For each PRIMARY issue identified (3-5 total), the system creates:
1. **1 PRIMARY Module** - Addresses the main issue
2. **5 SUPPORTING Modules** - Deep dive into related aspects:
   - Supporting Module 1: **Identifying Core Wounds**
   - Supporting Module 2: **Mapping Triggers**
   - Supporting Module 3: **Understanding the Pattern**
   - Supporting Module 4: **Resolution Planning & Coping Skills**
   - Supporting Module 5: **Daily Tasks & Sustainable Change**

**Total Modules:**
- 3 primary issues = 18 total modules (3 + 3√ó5)
- 4 primary issues = 24 total modules (4 + 4√ó5)
- 5 primary issues = 30 total modules (5 + 5√ó5)

**Each Module Contains:**
```typescript
{
  title: string,
  completed: boolean,
  steps: {
    identify: string,         // Core issue description
    trigger: string,          // What activates this issue
    origin: string,           // Root/history exploration
    behavior_change: string,  // Therapeutic technique
    daily_task: string,       // Specific 5-15 min daily task
    short_term_goal: string,  // 1-2 week goal
    long_term_goal: string,   // 2-3 month goal
  },
  questions: [               // 2 multiple-choice questions
    {
      id: string,
      question: string,
      options: string[]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Agent Chat Flow** (`src/ai/flows/agent-chat.ts`)

The agent chat has been upgraded with session phase tracking and strict protocol enforcement.

**New Features:**

#### Session Phase Tracking
```typescript
sessionPhase: 
  | 'opening' 
  | 'issue_identification'
  | 'core_analysis'
  | 'psychoeducation'
  | 'action_planning'
  | 'goal_assignment'
  | 'closing_check'
  | 'closed'
```

Agents now track which phase they're in and follow the protocol accordingly.

#### Session Summary Object
When closing a session, agents provide:
```typescript
sessionSummary: {
  issuesIdentified: string[],
  coreWounds: string[],
  triggersIdentified: string[],
  tasksAssigned: string[],
  goalsSet: string[],
  mantraProvided?: string
}
```

#### Strict System Prompt
The system prompt now includes:
- Reference to the session guide
- Phase-by-phase requirements
- Core analysis protocols
- Task assignment rules
- Mantra creation guidelines
- **CRITICAL closing protocol**
- List of what NOT to do

**Closing Protocol:**
1. Agent must ask "Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"
2. If YES ‚Üí Address briefly, ask again
3. If NO ‚Üí Set phase to 'closed' and give formal closing
4. **DO NOT** continue conversation after 'closed'
5. **DO NOT** start new topics or questions
6. **WAIT** for client to return and initiate next session

## üîÑ Agent Workflow

### Initial Questionnaire ‚Üí Roadmap Creation
```
User completes questionnaire
    ‚Üì
System identifies 3-5 primary issues
    ‚Üì
For each primary issue:
  - Create 1 primary module
  - Create 5 supporting modules
    ‚Üì
Generate 18-30 total modules
    ‚Üì
Store roadmap in localStorage
```

### Session Conduct
```
Client starts chat with agent
    ‚Üì
Agent follows session guide phases:
  1. Opening & Check-in
  2. Issue Identification
  3. Core Analysis (wounds + triggers)
  4. Psychoeducation
  5. Action Planning
  6. Goal & Task Assignment
  7. Closing Check ("Anything else?")
  8. Closed (formal ending)
    ‚Üì
Agent updates roadmap progress
    ‚Üì
Agent creates session notes
    ‚Üì
Agent WAITS for client to return
```

## üéì Usage for Agents

Agents are instructed to:

1. **Reference the session guide** for every interaction
2. **Track session phase** and progress systematically
3. **Follow the protocol** without skipping phases
4. **Use question banks** for relevant exploratory questions
5. **Identify core wounds** using the 7 common wounds framework
6. **Map triggers** using the 5-step trigger chain
7. **Provide psychoeducation** before suggesting interventions
8. **Assign specific tasks** (populate addTask object)
9. **Create mantras** when appropriate (populate mantra object)
10. **Close properly** with summary and "anything else?" question
11. **STOP after closing** - do not continue until client returns

---

## üîê Protocol Compliance

The system enforces strict compliance through:

### System Prompt Requirements:
- Explicit reference to session guide
- Phase-by-phase instructions
- List of critical DON'Ts
- Structured output schema with sessionPhase tracking

### Output Schema Validation:
- `sessionPhase` is required (tracks compliance)
- `sessionSummary` required during closing
- `addTask` object must be populated when assigning tasks
- `mantra` object must be populated when providing mantras

### Closing Protocol Enforcement:
- Must provide session summary
- Must ask "Is there anything else?"
- Must set phase to 'closed' when ending
- System can check if phase is 'closed' and prevent new messages

- More structured, professional therapeutic sessions
- Consistent approach across all agents
- Proper session boundaries

### Short-Term (1-2 weeks):
