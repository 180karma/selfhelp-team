- [ ] **Module: Your Relationship with Food**
    - **1. Identify the Issue:** Let's explore your primary relationship with food. Do you see it as fuel, comfort, a source of stress, or something else? We'll identify the core emotional connection you have with eating.
    - **2. Find the Trigger:** We'll pinpoint the specific situations, emotions, or times of day that trigger mindless eating, unhealthy cravings, or negative feelings about food.
    - **3. Change Behaviors to Improve:** We will introduce the practice of 'mindful eating' as a core strategy. This involves paying full attention to the experience of eating and drinking, both inside and outside the body.
    - **4. Daily Tasks:**
        - [ ] Practice the 'One-Minute Arrival': Before one meal each day, pause, take three deep breaths, and notice your level of hunger.
        - [ ] Log one 'Mindful Bite': For one bite of food per day, notice its texture, taste, and temperature.
    - **5. Short-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] For one week, keep a simple, judgment-free journal of what you eat and the emotions you feel before and after.
        - [ ] Identify and reduce one specific trigger food or situation.
    - **6. Long-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Develop an intuitive eating pattern where you confidently respond to your body's hunger and fullness cues.
        - [ ] Build a positive and peaceful relationship with food, free from guilt or anxiety.

- [ ] **Module: Understanding & Managing Anxiety**
    - **1. Identify the Issue:** Let's begin by mapping out your anxiety. We'll identify the primary physical sensations (e.g., racing heart, tight chest), emotions (e.g., fear, dread), and thoughts (e.g., "what if...") that anxiety creates for you.
    - **2. Find the Trigger:** We will work to identify the specific external triggers (situations, people) and internal triggers (thoughts, memories) that consistently provoke an anxious response.
    - **3. Change Behaviors to Improve:** The core strategy will be to practice 'grounding' techniques. These are simple exercises to pull you out of anxious thought loops and bring you back to the present moment, calming your nervous system.
    - **4. Daily Tasks:**
        - [ ] Practice the '5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique' once a day: Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    - **5. Short-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] For one week, log moments when you feel anxious and note the trigger that preceded it.
        - [ ] Successfully use a grounding technique to de-escalate your anxiety in a real-time situation.
    - **6. Long-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Develop a personalized 'anxiety toolkit' of coping strategies that you can deploy confidently.
        - [ ] Reduce avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, allowing you to re-engage with activities you value.

- [ ] **Module: Challenging Negative Automatic Thoughts (ANTs)**
    - **1. Identify the Issue:** Let's learn to spot 'ANTs'—the automatic negative thoughts that pop into your head and instantly affect your mood. We'll focus on a recurring 'hot thought' that causes you the most distress.
    - **2. Find the Trigger:** We'll identify the specific situations or internal states (like feeling tired or stressed) that are breeding grounds for this 'hot thought'.
    - **3. Change Behaviors to Improve:** Our primary tool will be the 'Thought Record.' This is a structured CBT exercise to catch, question, and reframe an ANT, thereby reducing its power.
    - **4. Daily Tasks:**
        - [ ] Identify and label at least one ANT today without needing to change it (e.g., "That's a 'catastrophizing' thought.").
    - **5. Short-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Complete one full 'Thought Record' for a distressing event this week, from identifying the trigger to formulating a balanced, alternative thought.
        - [ ] For a recurring ANT, list three pieces of objective evidence *against* it.
    - **6. Long-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Develop the skill of automatically catching and reframing ANTs in real-time, preventing them from spiraling into negative moods.
        - [ ] Internalize a more balanced and compassionate inner voice.

- [ ] **Module: Cultivating Self-Compassion & Soothing the Inner Critic**
    - **1. Identify the Issue:** Let's get to know your 'inner critic.' We'll identify its specific tone (e.g., harsh, sarcastic), its core messages (e.g., "You're not good enough"), and the feelings it brings up (e.g., shame, inadequacy).
    - **2. Find the Trigger:** We will pinpoint what activates your inner critic. Is it making a mistake, comparing yourself to others, or receiving feedback?
    - **3. Change Behaviors to Improve:** We will introduce the practice of 'Self-Compassion Breaks.' This involves three core components: acknowledging your suffering, recognizing that suffering is a shared human experience, and offering yourself kindness.
    - **4. Daily Tasks:**
        - [ ] Practice a 'Soothing Touch' exercise: Place a hand over your heart, feel the warmth, and take three gentle breaths. This is a non-verbal act of self-kindness.
    - **5. Short-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] The next time the inner critic is loud, try to simply label it ("There's the critic") without engaging with its content.
        - [ ] Write a compassionate letter to yourself from the perspective of a wise and loving friend, acknowledging a recent struggle.
    - **6. Long-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Cultivate an inner compassionate voice that can comfort and support you, becoming more prominent than the inner critic.
        - [ ] Develop the ability to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a dear friend.

- [ ] **Module: Overcoming the Motivation Hurdle**
    - **1. Identify the Issue:** Let's pinpoint the exact moment motivation fades. Is it the thought of working out, the act of getting ready, or the first five minutes of the exercise itself? We'll define the primary 'motivation barrier.'
    - **2. Find the Trigger:** What triggers this lack of motivation? Is it fatigue after work, feeling overwhelmed by the workout's length, or a belief that you 'don't have time'?
    - **3. Change Behaviors to Improve:** Our key strategy is the '5-Minute Rule.' You will commit to doing just five minutes of a planned activity. If you want to stop after five minutes, you get full credit. This breaks the cycle of inaction.
    - **4. Daily Tasks:**
        - [ ] Lay out your workout clothes the night before to reduce friction for the next day.
        - [ ] Use the '5-Minute Rule' to start one small physical activity (e.g., a walk, stretching).
    - **5. Short-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Successfully use the 5-Minute Rule three times this week to overcome the motivation barrier.
        - [ ] Schedule your workouts in your calendar like any other important appointment.
    - **6. Long-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Build a consistent fitness routine where starting is no longer the main obstacle.
        - [ ] Shift your focus from 'finding motivation' to 'cultivating discipline and habit.'

- [ ] **Module: Taming Procrastination & Building Momentum**
    - **1. Identify the Issue:** Let's target one specific, important task you've been avoiding. We'll identify the core feeling attached to it—is it overwhelm, boredom, or fear of not doing it perfectly?
    - **2. Find the Trigger:** What is your go-to procrastination activity? What's the cue that sends you into avoidance mode instead of starting the task?
    - **3. Change Behaviors to Improve:** We'll implement the 'Task Chunking' method. This involves breaking the big, intimidating task into tiny, concrete, 5-minute actions. The goal is to make the first step so easy it's impossible *not* to do.
    - **4. Daily Tasks:**
        - [ ] Identify your 'Most Important Task' (MIT) for the day.
        - [ ] 'Chunk down' your MIT into at least three tiny sub-tasks.
    - **5. Short-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Complete the first 'chunk' of a task you've been avoiding for over a week.
        - [ ] Use a timer to work on a single task for a focused 25-minute 'Pomodoro' session.
    - **6. Long-Term Goals:**
        - [ ] Develop a proactive system for tackling projects that minimizes stress and last-minute rushes.
        - [ ] Build self-trust by consistently following through on your intentions.
