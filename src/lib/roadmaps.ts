- [ ] **Module: Your Relationship with Food**
    ### 1. Emotional Awareness
    - When you think about your daily meals, what feelings come up for you (e.g., excitement, stress, guilt, indifference)?
    - How does your mood influence what you choose to eat during the day?
    - Can you describe a time you ate something because of how you were feeling, rather than because you were hungry?
    
    ### 2. Situational Triggers
    - What does a typical day of eating look like for you, from morning to night?
    - Are there specific times of day or activities (like watching TV) that you associate with eating?
    - How do your eating habits on weekends or social occasions differ from your weekday habits?

    ### 3. Root Cause Patterns
    - What messages about food did you receive growing up?
    - Is there a pattern to the types of food you crave when you're stressed, tired, or happy?
    - How does your energy level throughout the day affect your food choices for the next meal?

    ### 4. Life Impact
    - How do your current eating habits affect your energy, mood, and overall well-being?
    - In what ways does your relationship with food impact your social life or relationships?
    - What is one aspect of your diet you wish you could change, and why?
    - If you had your ideal relationship with food, what would that look like and feel like?

    ### Solutions & Action Plan
    - **Behavioral Solution:** Try keeping a simple food and mood journal for three days. Just jot down what you eat and how you feel, without judgment.
    - **Mental Exercise:** Before one meal each day, pause and take one deep breath. Ask yourself, "What does my body need right now?"
    - **Physical Tool:** Pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Try to rate your hunger on a scale of 1-10 before and after eating.
    - **Daily Task:** Drink one full glass of water before each meal.
    - **Short-Term Goal:** Plan and prepare one healthy meal you're excited about this week.
    - **Long-Term Goal:** Develop a habit of mindful eating where you feel in control and at peace with your food choices.

- [ ] **Module: Understanding & Managing Anxiety**
    ### 1. Emotional Awareness
    - When you feel anxious, what's the primary emotion you experience? Is it fear, worry, dread, or something else?
    - Can you describe what 'anxiety' feels like in your body? (e.g., tight chest, racing heart, butterflies in stomach)
    - How do you know when you're starting to feel anxious versus when you're in a full state of anxiety?
    
    ### 2. Situational Triggers
    - Are there specific situations, places, or people that consistently trigger your anxiety?
    - Think about the last time you felt anxious. What was happening in the moments leading up to it?
    - Do you notice your anxiety is worse at certain times of day or on certain days of the week?

    ### 3. Root Cause Patterns
    - What are the common 'what if...' thoughts that run through your mind when you're anxious?
    - Is there a core fear or belief underneath the anxiety? (e.g., fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of losing control)
    - How did your family or caregivers respond to your worries when you were younger?

    ### 4. Life Impact
    - How does anxiety impact your daily decisions, from small choices to big ones?
    - Are there activities, hobbies, or goals you avoid because of anxiety?
    - What is the biggest frustration anxiety causes in your life right now?
    - If you could reduce your anxiety by 25%, what would you start doing differently?

    ### Solutions & Action Plan
    - **Behavioral Solution:** When you feel anxiety rising, try the '3-3-3 rule': Name 3 things you see, 3 sounds you hear, and move 3 parts of your body. This grounds you in the present moment.
    - **Mental Exercise:** When you have an anxious thought, gently challenge it. Ask, "Is this thought 100% true? What's a more balanced perspective?"
    - **Physical Tool:** Practice 'box breathing' for one minute: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds.
    - **Daily Task:** Set aside 5 minutes for a 'worry period' where you allow yourself to worry, then consciously postpone any worries that arise outside that time.
    - **Short-Term Goal:** Choose one small, anxiety-provoking situation that you've been avoiding and take a tiny step towards facing it this week.
    - **Long-Term Goal:** Build a toolkit of coping strategies that allows you to manage anxiety and re-engage with activities you value.

- [ ] **Module: Challenging Negative Automatic Thoughts (ANTs)**
    ### 1. Emotional Awareness
    - Think of a recent time you felt a sudden shift in your mood (e.g., suddenly sad, angry, or anxious). What was the feeling?
    - Right before you felt that emotion, what thought went through your mind? (This is the Automatic Negative Thought or ANT).
    - On a scale of 0-100, how much did you believe that 'hot thought' in the moment?

    ### 2. Situational Triggers
    - In what types of situations do these ANTs most often appear? (e.g., at work, in social settings, when alone)
    - Who are you usually with, or what are you typically doing, when this pattern of thinking occurs?
    - Is there a physical state (like being tired or hungry) that makes you more vulnerable to ANTs?

    ### 3. Root Cause Patterns
    - What is a common cognitive distortion you recognize in your ANTs? (e.g., All-or-Nothing Thinking, Catastrophizing, Mind Reading)
    - Does this ANT connect to a deeper-seated 'core belief' about yourself, others, or the world? (e.g., "I'm not good enough," "I'm unlovable")
    - How has believing this thought pattern served you or protected you in the past, even if it's unhelpful now?

    ### 4. Life Impact
    - When you believe this ANT, how does it make you behave? What do you do or not do?
    - How does this thought pattern affect your relationships or your performance at work/school?
    - What is the long-term cost of repeatedly buying into this type of thought?
    - If you didn't have this thought, what would you do differently?

    ### Solutions & Action Plan
    - **Behavioral Solution:** Conduct a 'Behavioral Experiment'. If your ANT is "If I speak up in a meeting, everyone will think my idea is stupid," the experiment is to share one small idea and observe the actual result.
    - **Mental Exercise:** Complete a 'Thought Record'. Write down the Situation, ANT, Emotion, evidence for the ANT, evidence against it, and a new, more balanced thought.
    - **Physical Tool:** When you catch an ANT, place your hand on your chest, take a deep breath, and create physical distance from the thought, observing it as a mental event rather than a fact.
    - **Daily Task:** Identify and label at least one ANT and its cognitive distortion today without needing to change it.
    - **Short-Term Goal:** Complete one full Thought Record for a distressing event this week.
    - **Long-Term Goal:** Develop the skill of automatically catching, challenging, and reframing ANTs as they occur, reducing their emotional impact.

- [ ] **Module: Exploring Your Inner Critic & Self-Compassion**
    ### 1. Emotional Awareness
    - When your inner critic 'speaks,' what is the primary feeling it brings up? (e.g., shame, fear, sadness, inadequacy)
    - What is the tone of your inner critic? Is it harsh, sarcastic, dismissive, or something else?
    - Can you notice where you feel the critic's voice in your body? Is it a tension in your shoulders, a pit in your stomach?

    ### 2. Situational Triggers
    - When is your inner critic the loudest? (e.g., after making a mistake, when trying something new, when you're resting)
    - Are there specific people or comparisons that tend to activate your inner critic?
    - What happens right before the inner critic takes over? Are you tired, stressed, or feeling vulnerable?

    ### 3. Root Cause Patterns
    - Does the voice of your inner critic remind you of anyone from your past?
    - What was the 'function' of this critical voice? Did it develop to try and keep you safe, to avoid criticism from others, or to push you to succeed?
    - What are the core messages this critic repeats? (e.g., "You're not good enough," "You'll always fail," "Don't get your hopes up")

    ### 4. Life Impact
    - How does the inner critic stop you from taking risks or trying new things?
    - In what ways does this self-criticism affect your relationships or your willingness to be vulnerable?
    - What is the impact of this constant criticism on your physical energy and well-being?
    - If that critical voice were gone, what would you have the freedom to do or be?

    ### Solutions & Action Plan
    - **Behavioral Solution:** Practice 'compassionate action'. The next time the critic appears, ask, "What would I do for a dear friend in this situation?" Then, try to do that for yourself (e.g., make tea, take a short walk).
    - **Mental Exercise:** 'Soften, Soothe, Allow.' When the critic is harsh, say to yourself (internally or out loud), "This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is a part of life. May I be kind to myself in this moment."
    - **Physical/Somatic Tool:** Place a hand over your heart. Feel the warmth and gentle pressure. Breathe into that space for one minute, offering yourself a moment of comfort without needing to fix anything.
    - **Daily Task:** Notice your inner critic one time today and, instead of fighting it, just label it: "Ah, there's the critic."
    - **Short-Term Goal:** Write a compassionate letter to yourself from the perspective of a wise, kind friend, acknowledging a recent struggle.
    - **Long-Term Goal:** To cultivate an inner compassionate voice that is stronger and more accessible than the inner critic.

- [ ] **Module: Overcoming Your Biggest Fitness Obstacle**
    ### 1. Emotional Awareness
    - When you think about your biggest obstacle to fitness, what's the main feeling that comes up? (e.g., frustration, overwhelm, guilt, apathy)
    - How do you feel physically on days you overcome this obstacle versus days you don't?
    - What's the internal story you tell yourself about this obstacle? (e.g., "I'm just too busy," "I'm not a fitness person")

    ### 2. Situational Triggers
    - At what exact moment does this obstacle usually win? (e.g., hitting snooze, sitting on the couch after work, opening the fridge)
    - What are the environmental factors? Is your workout gear hidden away? Is your calendar too packed?
    - Are there certain people or social situations that reinforce this obstacle?

    ### 3. Root Cause Patterns
    - Have you faced a similar obstacle in other areas of your life, not just fitness?
    - What is the 'payoff' for giving in to the obstacle? (e.g., comfort, avoiding discomfort, more free time in the short-term)
    - What past experiences with exercise might be contributing to this obstacle? (e.g., negative experiences in PE, feeling judged at a gym)

    ### 4. Life Impact
    - How does this specific obstacle impact your energy and confidence in other areas of your life?
    - What is the cumulative effect of this obstacle over a month or a year?
    - If this one obstacle were removed, what would become possible for you?
    - How does this obstacle conflict with the person you want to be?

    ### Solutions & Action Plan
    - **Behavioral Solution:** 'Habit Stacking.' Link a new fitness habit to an existing one. For example, "After I brush my teeth in the morning, I will immediately put on my workout clothes."
    - **Mental Exercise:** 'Temptation Bundling.' Pair the activity you're avoiding with something you enjoy. "I will only listen to my favorite podcast while I'm out for a walk."
    - **Physical Tool:** Prepare your environment. If your obstacle is morning workouts, lay out your clothes, shoes, and water bottle the night before. Make the first step ridiculously easy.
    - **Daily Task:** Complete a 5-minute "movement snack" (e.g., 5 minutes of stretching, walking, or bodyweight squats).
    - **Short-Term Goal:** Successfully navigate your primary obstacle on three separate occasions this week.
    - **Long-Term Goal:** To create a system and environment that makes your biggest fitness obstacle irrelevant.

- [ ] **Module: Taming Procrastination**
    ### 1. Emotional Awareness
    - When you're procrastinating on a specific task, what is the core feeling you're avoiding? (e.g., boredom, overwhelm, fear of failure, confusion)
    - What emotion do you feel *while* you're procrastinating (e.g., temporary relief, guilt, mounting anxiety)?
    - How do you feel physically when you finally start the task versus when you're avoiding it?

    ### 2. Situational Triggers
    - What types of tasks do you most often procrastinate on? (e.g., complex projects, boring chores, difficult conversations)
    - What is your go-to procrastination activity? (e.g., scrolling social media, cleaning something else, watching TV)
    - Are there certain times of day or environments where you are more likely to procrastinate?

    ### 3. Root Cause Patterns
    - Is perfectionism a factor? Do you delay starting because you're afraid you can't do it perfectly?
    - Does the task feel disconnected from your values or long-term goals, making it feel meaningless?
    - When you think about the task, do you focus on the difficulty of starting or the relief of finishing?

    ### 4. Life Impact
    - What is the real-world consequence of procrastinating on this type of task? (e.g., missed deadlines, added stress, disappointing others)
    - How does the stress of the unfinished task affect your ability to relax and enjoy your free time?
    - What opportunities have you missed out on because of procrastination?
    - How does procrastination impact your self-esteem and how you see yourself?

    ### Solutions & Action Plan
    - **Behavioral Solution:** Use the '5-Minute Rule'. Commit to working on the dreaded task for just five minutes. If you want to stop after five minutes, you can, but you'll often build momentum to continue.
    - **Mental Exercise:** 'Chunking'. Break the overwhelming task into tiny, specific, and actionable steps. Instead of "work on report," the first step is "open document and write one sentence."
    - **Physical Tool:** Create a 'distraction-free' zone. Put your phone in another room, close unnecessary tabs, and set a clear intention for your focused work block.
    - **Daily Task:** Identify your single 'Most Important Task' (MIT) for the day and do it first, before anything else.
    - **Short-Term Goal:** Use the 5-Minute Rule to start a task you've been avoiding for a week.
    - **Long-Term Goal:** To develop a proactive approach to tasks, reducing the stress and negative self-talk associated with procrastination.
